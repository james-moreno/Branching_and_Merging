https://github.com/james-moreno/Branching_and_Merging

I branched and merged but closed the command line before realizing I needed 
it as proof of doing the work.

Please check the URL to see the project on GITHUB and take my word that I 
am capable of branching and mergin the changes from the branch back into the master.
